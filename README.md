# IOTACsharpDemoUtils

This repository is used for IOTA demos and testing of variety of C# libraries (https://github.com/Felandil/tangle-.net). All the examples have been shown in the documentation I have been writing over a span of few weeks that can be found here https://patriq.gitbook.io/iota/. All seeds used here are on devnet so they're not important.
